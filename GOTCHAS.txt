It's possible to define a function using multiple-word quote and quote that aren't consisted of words:
```
[ foo bar ] [ dup * ] def
[ 1 ] [ dup * ] def
```
but there's no way to call such a function.
For the rest of the language, I see no reason yet to distinct between single- and multi-expression quotes, so it might be a good idea to perform a check in `def`.
In Lisp, one of the seven primitive operators is `atom` that would return `t` only for single-word quotes.
